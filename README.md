# FreeFalcon

A campain based, multiplayer, open source flight simulator.

## About FreeFalcon

FreeFalcon was once a project to mod the original Microprose Falcon 4.0
Combat Simulator. Most of the development was done from a small group of
people dedicated to the scene. Now we're going open source, and anybody can
contribute.

## Configuration

To set up the source code to run in Debug mode, you'll need an install of
FreeFalcon on your computer. To tell Visual Studio where this installation is,
right click on the FFViper project and select Properties from the dropdown.
Under Configuration Options in the window that pops up, select Debugging and
edit the Working Directory to the root of your FreeFalcon install.

## Contributing

You can contribute to the project in various ways.

 * If you're a programmer, go ahead, fork us and hack away! If you feel that
   you have something good going, send a pull request and we'll talk about
   getting your code into the main source tree.
 * If you're not a programmer, not to worry! Just let us know if you find any
   bugs or have any suggestions in the issue tracker.

## Legal

FreeFalcon doesn't have the cleanest history regarding its terms of use, but
that all ends here. The code is now licensed under the rather liberal BSD
2-clause license; for the first time in its history, FreeFalcon is truly free.
